NEW TO AI? 
Read these:

1. [The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence (Part 1)](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html): an in-depth article by Tim Urban on AI which explains ANI, AGI and ASI 
2. The AI Revolution: Our Immortality or Extinction (Part 2): analyses all the different scenarios of the impact of AGI and ASI in the (near) future
3. What’s the difference between data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence: a great article that goes beyond the common idea that machine learning is simply a sub-part of AI.
4. A visual introduction to machine learning: using a real example and straightforward visualisations this article helps us understand how to create a machine learning model to distinguish homes in New York from homes in San Francisco. The model tackles and uses decision trees which are if-then statements to define patterns in the data.
5. Model Tuning and the Bias-Variance Trade-off (Part 2): explains how a model overly simplistic (bias) or overly complex (variance) both lead to errors hence the need to build models with a balance between the two.
